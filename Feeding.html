<main>	<h1>Feeding</h1>
        <h2>Feeding Cues</h2>
        <p>Babies will generally give “feeding cues” when hungry.  Feeding cues include but are not limited to: licking lips, stirring or moving head side to side, sucking movement of the mouth or tongue, moving their hands to their mouth, and fidgeting.  Feeding cues vary from baby to baby.</p>
	<h2>Breastfeeding</h2>
	<p>Benefits: is generally healthier for the baby and you</p>
	<p>Making Milk: Milk production is regulated by supply and demand.  Supplementing formula may decrease milk production.  Expressing milk (by hand or pump) can help increase or maintain milk production and provide milk to be stored.</p>
	<p>To Breastfeed: Start by making sure you and your baby are relaxed and close.  There are many positions to breastfeed, but the most common is probably the “laid-back and baby led” one.  Lean backwards and place your baby so their head is on your chest (near the nipple).  Gravity will keep the baby close to you, though you can support the baby if you wish.  Oftentimes, babies will find the nipple on their own and latch on.  If needed, you can assist them.  With a proper latch, you should feel little to no biting or pinching.</p>
	<h2>Formula</h2>
	<p>Formula is something that should be discussed before leaving the hospital.</p>
	<h2>Feeding Patterns</h2>
	<p>For Day 1: Babies don’t feed a lot.  They spend a lot of time resting.</p>
	<p>For Day 2: Babies are generally hungrier, and start to feed a lot more.  They start giving more feeding cues.</p>
	<p>For Day 3: Babies generally cluster feed (where they start to feed a lot during certain time windows [such as feeding 5 times in a 3 hour period])</p>
	<p>For Day 4: Baby may start sleeping more during the day and feeding more at night.  The baby should be nursing at least 8 times per 24 hour period.</p>
	<h2>Burping</h2>
	<p>To burp a baby, pat their back (or stroke upwards).  You can do this while the baby is “over the shoulder”, “belly down across your lap”, or “sitting with chin supported”.</p>
	<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
	<p>Rubbing a baby’s back or legs can help keep them awake while feeding</p>
	<p>Feed a baby as much as they like (watch for feeding cues!) but try to feed them at least 8 times in a 24 hour period.</p>
	<p>Don’t drink alcohol, smoke, or vape while breastfeeding.  The chemicals from these things can get into the breast milk and affect your baby!</p>
	<p>Ask a doctor about the medications you take and if it's safe to breastfeed while taking them!</p>
